## About Me
I've been in-and-out of the cyberspace for quite some time. Ever since I was a kid, actually. I used to play a ton of games, and always wondered how they were created. That's how I got into programming. Reverse engineering is a different story, I always been curious on how people would be able to release paid software for free (cracking). This certainly became a bigger part of my life as I started to sell products. I found out about reverse engineering which led me to meet some amazing people. Throughout the entire time, I never really had a very, secure means of protecting Python applications. There are some well known obfuscation services out there, the most noteable being PyArmor, however there are many people including myself who can reverse engineer binaries obfuscated with PyArmor. That's when I started developing my own. I named it, Wrath.
